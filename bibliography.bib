abstract = {Is experience stored in the brain? The answer to this question is critical, for it strongly constrains possible theories of the nature and origin of consciousness. If the answer is "yes," conscious experience must be generated from stored "elements" within the neural structure. If the answer is "no," Searle's principle of neurobiological sufficiency, as one example, carries no force. On the other hand, a theory of direct perception can be construed to actually require a "no" answer, but then would require a theory of memory not reliant on brain storage. Perception research is reviewed which describes the invariance laws defining the elementary, time-extended, perceived events that must be "stored" and which speaks simultaneously to the nature of the qualia of these events. To support this description of perceived, external events, a model of "direct memory" is described, wherein the brain is viewed as supporting a modulated reconstructive wave passing through a holographic matter-field. The modulation pattern is determined or driven by the invariance laws defining external events. The model is applied to several areas of memory theory in cued-recall, to include verbal paired-associate learning, concreteness and imagery, subject performed tasks and priming. Some implications are reviewed for cognition in general, mental imagery, eye-witness phenomena and the question of whether everything experienced is "stored." The model is predictive and at the very least holds its own relative to current theory without appealing to storage of experience within the brain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

@article{Robbins2013,
abstract = {This paper proposes that the hard problem of consciousness is in fact the problem of the origin of our image of the external world. This formulation in terms of the "image" is never seen stated, for the forms populating our image of the world are considered computable, and not considered qualia - the "redness" of the cube is regarded as the problem, not the cube as a form. Form, however, cannot be divorced from motion and hence from time. Therefore we must re-examine the classic spatial metaphysics of space and time, initiated by Galilei, wherein the real has been equated with the quantitative and wherein quality has been stripped from the material world. In this metaphysics, which sees form as quantitative or computable, the origin of qualia is problematic, and a problem of even greater primacy is the memory that supports the transforming events of perception. This article argues that memory is a necessary condition for qualia. The storage of "snapshots" of time-flowing events, a notion which the classic metaphysics engenders, is unworkable as a solution to the perception of these flows. Form, in fact being dynamic and defined over flowing fields, is a quality requiring this memory. Since forms populate the image, the origin of the entire image is indeed a problem. The proposed solution is based on Bergson's temporal metaphysics wherein motion is undivided, and the global motion of the universal field itself carries an intrinsic form of memory. In this framework, Bergson provided a unique solution - one that leaves the problem of representation behind - as to how the brain specifies the qualitative image of the dynamically transforming external world. {\textcopyright} 2013 Imprint Academic.},

I dismantle two main strategies for explaining these inconsistencies.

abstract = {Bergson's critique of intensive magnitude in Time and Free Will mainly targets Kant's “Anticipations of Perception”, in which the Kantian distinction between matter and form is lowered. Bergson praises precisely this distinction for safeguarding sensation as something extra-intellectual. As the concept of intensity is the main tool of neo-Kantian intellectualism, in which the whole of reality is determined by the intellect, younger Bergson forcefully rejects intensive magnitude. However, his relation towards Kant changes. In Creative Evolution, Bergson proposes a genetic correction to Kantianism in which the distinction between matter and form is weakened. By comparing Bergson's theory with the genetic Kantianism of Salomon Ma{\"{i}}mon, who heavily relies on the concept of intensity, I argue that the concept fits his later project of renewing the Kantian theory. I thus demonstrate how the critique of intensive magnitude merely belongs to a provisional stage of Bergson's relation to Kant.},

In the first two sections I reevaluate Bergson's critique, showing what, according to Bergson, are the good and bad senses of intensity, and how this critique allowed Bergson to institute a new conception of difference as expressed in concrete continuity.

@article{Lundy2018,
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to excavate and analyse Henri Bergson's “problematic” thinking. This task will be prosecuted through a close reading of his two-part introduction to The Creative Mind – the text in which Bergson most concisely and conclusively articulates the “problematic” character of his work. As I will attempt to show in this paper, Bergson's work is “problematic” in two respects, one to do with methodology and the other metaphysics. These two, furthermore, are intimately entwined: on the one hand, Bergson's method of problematisation emerges from the findings of his metaphysical inquiries, while on the other, it is through the application of his problematising method that the findings of his metaphysical inquiries can be deemed as reliably accurate. In exploring this “problematic” intersection of Bergson's methodology and metaphysics, I will first discuss what Bergson takes to be one of the biggest problems for philosophy: the lack of adequate “precision.” As we will see, many of the major themes and concepts of Bergson's work, such as duration and intuition, both spring from and converge on his efforts to address this problem. The pursuit of precision also calls for a “problematic approach” that is appropriate for the metaphysical reality it seeks to handle – an approach I will outline in the second part of this paper. This will be followed by a discussion of how Bergson's problematic method/metaphysics involves a critique of what he refers to as “fictitious,” “phantom” or “pseudo-problems.” This “negative” aspect of Bergsonian problematisation will then be reconsidered in the final part of the paper alongside its “positive” dimension – posing problems in terms of time.

abstract = {The article focuses on the analysis of “pure experience” (junsui keiken), one of the key concepts in the early philosophy of Nishida Kitarō, major Japanese philosopher of the twentieth century, as reflected in his first important book An Inquiry into the Good (Zen no kenkyu). Notwithstanding its Zen Buddhist origin, Nishidean “pure experience” bears strong similarities with the philosophical perspectives of such “psychologically oriented” western thinkers as Wil/iam James and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Nishida, being in constant dialogue and discussion with the western philosophical tradition, was in constant search of the “logic of the East” as different from that of the West. In contrast to a classical western rationalist position treating perceptive experience as a passive, nebulous and non-discriminating state of consciousness, and reflection as active and creative, Nishida argues for a “systematic character of consciousness” from the very start, “when there is still no subject and object”. Therefore it seems productive for the purposes of the present article to link the concept of “pure experience” to one of the most fundamental philosophical categories, to that of order. For; we strongly believe, it is here that the obvious differences between Nishida and his western counterparts is revealed, bringing him close, however; to the “artistic standpoints” of such western authors as Nietzsche and the above mentioned French phenomenologist Merleau-Ponty.},

abstract = {The problem of time has been fascinating thinkers since ancient times. Many philosophers (such as Plato, Aristotle, and Kant) and scientists (such as Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein) have tried to conceptualize and analyze time in many ways. There are two main concepts about time recognized as firstly, physical time that is objective and secondly, psychological time that is subjective and has a mind-dependent existence. In Theravada Buddhist philosophy, the idea that time does not exist independently is quite significant. Although many Western thinkers (such as the names mentioned in the pre- vious paragraph) were interested in investigating the concept of time, only some of them agree with the idea that time existence depends on the mind. Henri Bergson, a renowned French philosopher, is one among a few who supported the idea that time is mind dependent since he suggested that real time, which he called “duration”, exists merely in our consciousness. In this study, the researcher has critically examined Buddhist and Henri Bergson's concepts of time and sought to identify their similarities and their distinctiveness. This research compared a basic concept from Buddhist philosophy, the concept of time, with Henri Bergson's concept of time. The objective of this research was not to finalize the philosophical argument about the concept of time, but to attempt to come to a certain level of conclusion about the characteristics of time in Buddhism that have similar qualities as well as different qualities to the characteristics of time in Henri Bergson's explanation based on Thai philosophers' viewpoints.},

We refute a conjecture put forward by Hoffmann-Jorgensen, who conjectured that the existence of a complete Mammen space implies the Axiom of Choice, by showing that in the first Cohen model, in which ZF holds but AC fails, there is a complete Mammen space. We obtain this by proving that in the first Cohen model, every perfect topology can be extended to a maximal perfect topology. On the other hand, we also show that if all sets are Lebesgue measurable, or all sets are Baire measurable, then there are no complete Mammen spaces with a countable universe. Further, we investigate two new cardinal invariants and associated with complete Mammen spaces and maximal perfect topologies, and establish some basic inequalities that are provable in ZFC.

We set up a framework which naturally subsumes this feature by defining a compact closed category where morphisms represent conscious processes. These morphisms are a composition of a set of generators, each being specified by their relations with other generators, and therefore co-dependent. The framework is general enough and fits well into a compositional model of consciousness.

The Anti-foundation Axiom plays a significant role in our development, since among other of its features, its replacement for the Axiom of Foundation in the Zermelo-Fr{\"{a}}nkel Axioms motivates Platonic interpretations. These interpretations also depend on such allied notions for sets as pictures, graphs, decorations, labelings and various mappings that we use. A syntax and semantics of operators acting on sets is developed. Such features enable construction of a theory of non-well-founded sets that we use to frame mathematical foundations of consciousness. To do this we introduce a supplementary axiomatic system that characterizes experience and consciousness as primitives. The new axioms proceed through characterization of so-called consciousness operators. The Russell operator plays a central role and is shown to be one example of a consciousness operator. Neural networks supply striking examples of non-well-founded graphs the decorations of which generate associated sets, each with a Platonic aspect. Employing our foundations, we show how the supervening of consciousness on its neural correlates in the brain enables the framing of a theory of consciousness by applying appropriate consciousness operators to the generated sets in question. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is conjectured that qualia and measurements have the same nature, corresponding to fundamental processes via which classical information is produced and physically stored, and that therefore the hard problem of consciousness and the measurement problem are two facets of the same problem. The space of qualia is independent from any preexisting notions of spacetime and conscious agent, but its structure caters for a derived geometric model of observer.

abstract = {Is experience stored in the brain? The answer to this question is critical, for it strongly constrains possible theories of the nature and origin of consciousness. If the answer is "yes," conscious experience must be generated from stored "elements" within the neural structure. If the answer is "no," Searle's principle of neurobiological sufficiency, as one example, carries no force. On the other hand, a theory of direct perception can be construed to actually require a "no" answer, but then would require a theory of memory not reliant on brain storage. Perception research is reviewed which describes the invariance laws defining the elementary, time-extended, perceived events that must be "stored" and which speaks simultaneously to the nature of the qualia of these events. To support this description of perceived, external events, a model of "direct memory" is described, wherein the brain is viewed as supporting a modulated reconstructive wave passing through a holographic matter-field. The modulation pattern is determined or driven by the invariance laws defining external events. The model is applied to several areas of memory theory in cued-recall, to include verbal paired-associate learning, concreteness and imagery, subject performed tasks and priming. Some implications are reviewed for cognition in general, mental imagery, eye-witness phenomena and the question of whether everything experienced is "stored." The model is predictive and at the very least holds its own relative to current theory without appealing to storage of experience within the brain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract = {This paper proposes that the hard problem of consciousness is in fact the problem of the origin of our image of the external world. This formulation in terms of the "image" is never seen stated, for the forms populating our image of the world are considered computable, and not considered qualia - the "redness" of the cube is regarded as the problem, not the cube as a form. Form, however, cannot be divorced from motion and hence from time. Therefore we must re-examine the classic spatial metaphysics of space and time, initiated by Galilei, wherein the real has been equated with the quantitative and wherein quality has been stripped from the material world. In this metaphysics, which sees form as quantitative or computable, the origin of qualia is problematic, and a problem of even greater primacy is the memory that supports the transforming events of perception. This article argues that memory is a necessary condition for qualia. The storage of "snapshots" of time-flowing events, a notion which the classic metaphysics engenders, is unworkable as a solution to the perception of these flows. Form, in fact being dynamic and defined over flowing fields, is a quality requiring this memory. Since forms populate the image, the origin of the entire image is indeed a problem. The proposed solution is based on Bergson's temporal metaphysics wherein motion is undivided, and the global motion of the universal field itself carries an intrinsic form of memory. In this framework, Bergson provided a unique solution - one that leaves the problem of representation behind - as to how the brain specifies the qualitative image of the dynamically transforming external world. {\textcopyright} 2013 Imprint Academic.},

The more general problem is explaining the origin of the image of the external world. Bergson had a unique solution to this problem, not understood at the time nor yet today because it was a holographic solution formulated fifty years before the invention of holography. Bergson had intuited a vision of the universe as a holographic field, but as opposed to theorists such as Bohm (1980) or Pribram (1971), he viewed the brain, in essence, as forming a modulated reconstructive wave passing through this holographic field, specific to a source within the field – by this process now an image, e.g., a coffee cup with stirring spoon, “out there,” on the table. J. J. Gibson and his “direct perception” is Bergson's natural complement. Combined with Bergson's theory of time – his temporal metaphysic – this is a unique form of panpsychism.},

abstract = {Is experience stored in the brain? The answer to this question is critical, for it strongly constrains possible theories of the nature and origin of consciousness. If the answer is "yes," conscious experience must be generated from stored "elements" within the neural structure. If the answer is "no," Searle's principle of neurobiological sufficiency, as one example, carries no force. On the other hand, a theory of direct perception can be construed to actually require a "no" answer, but then would require a theory of memory not reliant on brain storage. Perception research is reviewed which describes the invariance laws defining the elementary, time-extended, perceived events that must be "stored" and which speaks simultaneously to the nature of the qualia of these events. To support this description of perceived, external events, a model of "direct memory" is described, wherein the brain is viewed as supporting a modulated reconstructive wave passing through a holographic matter-field. The modulation pattern is determined or driven by the invariance laws defining external events. The model is applied to several areas of memory theory in cued-recall, to include verbal paired-associate learning, concreteness and imagery, subject performed tasks and priming. Some implications are reviewed for cognition in general, mental imagery, eye-witness phenomena and the question of whether everything experienced is "stored." The model is predictive and at the very least holds its own relative to current theory without appealing to storage of experience within the brain. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract = {The serious import of Gibson's statement warning that physics “abstractions” of space and time “are not appropriate to psychology,” has not been understood. Underlying the space and time of physics is a largely unexamined metaphysic, what can be termed the “classic” (or spatial) metaphysic. This metaphysic is what Gibson implicitly rejected. His concept of direct perception, and necessarily then, direct memory, rely on, in fact, require, an alternative metaphysic of space and time for their understandability–what can be termed a “temporal metaphysic,” a framework which was explicitly developed by Bergson in Matter and Memory.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
